# 0x00. Personal Data Management

This project focuses on managing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in back-end applications, emphasizing authentication and secure data handling. By the end of this project, you'll learn how to secure sensitive data, filter logs, and encrypt user credentials using Python.

## Project Overview

**Topics:**
- Personal Data Management
- Back-End Development
- Authentication

## Resources

To complete this project, itâ€™s recommended to read the following resources:
- [What Is PII, non-PII, and Personal Data?](#)
- [Logging Documentation](#)
- [bcrypt Package Documentation](#)
- [Logging to Files, Setting Levels, and Formatting](#)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:
1. Identify examples of Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
2. Implement log filtering to obfuscate PII fields in logs.
3. Encrypt passwords securely and validate them against user inputs.
4. Authenticate a database connection using environment variables.

## Requirements

- **Platform:** Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- **Python Version:** Python 3.7
- **Style:** [pycodestyle](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/) (version 2.5)
- **Executable Files:** All files must be executable
- **Documentation:** 
    - Each module, class, and function should have detailed documentation.
    - Documentation should include the purpose and functionality of each component.
- **Type Annotations:** Required for all functions
- **README.md:** This file should be included at the root of the project folder.
- **New Line:** All files should end with a new line.
- **Shebang:** The first line of all Python files should be `#!/usr/bin/env python3`

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd project_folder
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run tests to ensure everything is set up correctly:
   ```bash
   ./run_tests.sh
   ```

## Usage

Once set up, the project allows you to manage sensitive data securely by:
- Obfuscating PII fields in logs.
- Encrypting and validating user passwords.
- Configuring environment-based authentication to secure database connections.
